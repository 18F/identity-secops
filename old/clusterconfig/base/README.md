# Cluster Kubernetes Config

This is where we create and configure the core services that are running
in the cluster.

## ELK

To create the ELK config files, run `./render-elk.sh` in this directory.
It will get the elasticsearch helm charts and render them into yml files
in this directory which you can check in.
